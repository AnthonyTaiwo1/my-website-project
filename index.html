      <P> The first image is of a PSU (Power Supply Unit) that was designed during uni. The video is of the testing stage of a robot that was designed as part of a group project at uni. I oversaw the RF frequency communication and the movement of the robot. The last picture is how the robot looked after it was built.</P>
